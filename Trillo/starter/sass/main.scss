==== FLEX ====

Flex Container:
- flex-direction: determines direction flow of items
    - default main axis is 'row'
    - set flex-direction to 'column' to change main axis 
- flex-wrap
- justify-content: Controls how the items are positioned across the main axis
- align-items: Controls how the items are positioned across the cross-axis (default is stretch. meaning all items will be of same height as tallest item)
- align-content: Only for multiple rows. Controls how the rows are positioned on the cross axis

Flex Items:
- align-self: same as align-items but just for 1 item
- order: determines the order of which the item appears in the flex container

Helps determine width of flex item:
- flex-grow: defines how much space an item can take relative to other items
- flex-shrink: defines how an item shrinks
    - setting flex-shrink to 1 means that it is allowed to shrink
    - default is 1
    - 0 means no shrinking is allowed 
- flex-basis: set width (ie. 20%)

flex: <flex-grow> <flex-shrink> <flex-basis>
